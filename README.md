## contributing

we like pull requests that:

- add new content
- fix bugs in modern browsers
- improve visual design
- make transformer easier to understand/use/get started with

please don't send pull requests that do the following:

- reorganize css
- optimize images
- refactor without making any changes to the website

the browserify website currently does its job well and doesn't have any scaling problems. the overhead of merging in refactoring style pull requests just isn't worth it for us. sorry!
